checkra1n dump and poc for iOS  

note:  
This poc uses the payload dumped from checkra1n 0.12.2 beta.  
This tool is for testing purposes. Do not use it on a normal device.  

target devices:  
- iPhone 7(t8010): for iOS 14(.3)  
- iPhone 8(t8015): for iOS 13(.5)  
*pongoOS has been modified to give xargs "rootdev=md0 -v"  

tested devices(host slide):  
iPhone 5s (iOS 12.5.1): works  
iPhone 8 (iOS 13.5): works  
iPhone 5s (iOS 9.1): successful checkm8 and loaded stage2, but Unable to send pongoOS. (Power consumption is too high)  
iPhone 5 (iOS 10.2.1): successful checkm8 and loaded stage2, but Unable to send pongoOS. (Power consumption is too high)  


build:  
cd src/  
./mk_macosx.sh  
./mk_iphoneos_arm64.sh  
*In order to build for iphoneos, you need to copy some headers such as IOKit from the macOS SDK.  

definition lists:  
-DHAVE_DEBUG: Enables the display of some messages.  
-DIPHONEOS_ARM: Allows iOS to connect to iOS devices. For lightning device, require the "lightning to usb camera adapter".  
-DIPHONEOS_LOWSPEC: Prevents some unnecessary functions from working so that they will work even when run on low spec devices (such as Apple A7).  
-DLOW_IPHONEOS_VERSION: Older iOS versions such as iOS 10 can't get the serial number, so don't get it.
